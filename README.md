# ETL_SSIS_Project

Available data from STM (Société de transport de Montréal - English: Montreal Transit Corporation) http://www.stm.info/en/about/developers/available-data-description.

Files:

Agency.txt : Basic information about the STM
Calendar.txt : Information about service availability
Calendar_dates.txt : List of days included in assignment period
Fare_attributes.txt : List of various STM fares
Fare_rules.txt : Explains different fares for regular service and airport shuttle
Feed.txt : Contains information about the feed itself
Frequencies.txt : Defines the frequency of metro service
Routes.txt : List of bus lines
Shapes.txt : Definition of rules for drawing a bus line itinerary on map
Stop_times.txt : Schedule of arrival times at bus stops
Stops.txt : List of bus stops
Trips.txt : Information about trip schedules

Goal:
Organize the data so it is possible to produce operational reports based on the bus/metro schedule as well as providing analysts with tools to better understand the hidden patterns and anomalies with the bus and metro schedules.

Steps: 
1) Create a Database Called STM_SRC 
2) Use .stg  and dbo schemas to organize Extraction/Transformation/Loading
3) Use SQL Queries and SSIS Tasks during the ETL process.
4) Implement a DW with 4 Dimension tables and 1 Fact table.

Obs.: The SQL Query used to load the Fact Table used a paremeter because of the machine's memory limitation.
